    <p>     WorldWideWeb was a piece of software written by Sir Tim Berners-Lee at CERN as a replacement for      Gopher. It and HTML v1 were made open source software in 1993. The World Wide Web as we know it        started with this piece of software.   </p>   <h3>Browser Wars</h3>   <p>The openness of WorldWideWeb meant many different web browsers were created early on, including Netscape Navigator and NCSA Mosaic, which later became Microsoft Edge.</p>
